🔍 I'm not a coder. I'm a chartered accountant with 30 years in finance.

But I just built two AI-powered apps - without writing a single line of code.

It started with Ed Donner's excellent Udemy courses on AI engineering. If you're looking to understand LLMs, RAG, and agentic AI, I can't recommend them highly enough:

→ LLM Engineering, RAG, QLoRA, Agents: https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/
→ Agentic AI & MCP: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-agentic-ai-engineering-course/

Thanks Ed Donner for the foundation that made this possible!

Armed with that knowledge, Claude and I built:
📊 SEC Corporate Research Assistant - multi-agent system analysing 10-K/10-Q filings (~$0.30 per company)
🍹 AI Liquor Cabinet - built in one day using Next.js (a framework I don't even know!)

Andrej Karpathy gave us "vibe coding." I'm calling what I do "vibe analysis."

The difference? Domain expertise + AI collaboration = building analytical tools, not just chatting with data.

Some hard-won lessons:
→ AI broke my balance sheet verification. Backups are essential.
→ Use expensive models only where depth matters
→ "Vibe" doesn't mean "careless"

The person asking the smartest questions can now build the answers.
