## The Problem

Every home bartender knows the feeling. You're standing in front of your liquor cabinet, guests are waiting, and you're trying to remember: *Do I have everything for a Negroni? What about that bottle of Aperol - is there enough left for a Spritz?*

I wanted an app that could:

1. **Know what I have** - without manual data entry
2. **Suggest what I can make** - based on actual inventory
3. **Work hands-free** - because my hands are often busy in the kitchen
4. **Run on my Google Nest Hub** - the screen that's already in my kitchen

And I wanted to build it cheaply enough to share with friends.

## What I Built

The result is **Liquor Cabinet** - an AI-powered inventory and cocktail suggestion app with seven core features:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **AI Bottle ID** | Photograph a bottle → Claude Vision identifies it |
| **Inventory Management** | Track bottles by category with quantity controls |
| **Recipe Suggestions** | AI recommends cocktails based on what you have |
| **Recipe Search** | Look up any cocktail by name |
| **Voice Search** | 🎤 Hands-free search in the kitchen |
| **Kitchen Mode** | Large-format display optimised for Nest Hub |
| **Multi-user** | Friends get their own private cabinets |

## The Tech Stack

I chose tools that would be free (or nearly free) at small scale:

| Component | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 | Modern React, great developer experience |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Generous free tier, built-in auth |
| **AI** | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Vision capable, extremely cost-effective |
| **Hosting** | Vercel | Free for hobby projects |
| **Voice** | Web Speech API | Native browser support, no extra cost |
| **Auth** | Google OAuth via Supabase | One-click sign-in |

## The Interesting Bits

### Claude Vision for Bottle Identification

The core magic is Claude's vision capability. When you photograph a bottle, the app sends the image to Claude Haiku with a prompt asking it to identify:

- Brand name
- Spirit type (whisky, gin, vodka, etc.)
- Volume (if visible)

```typescript
// Simplified version of the bottle identification call
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001",
  max_tokens: 1024,
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: [
      {
        type: "image",
        source: { type: "base64", media_type: "image/jpeg", data: imageBase64 }
      },
      {
        type: "text", 
        text: "Identify this bottle. Return JSON with: brand, spirit_type, volume_ml"
      }
    ]
  }]
});
```

**Key learning:** Claude Haiku occasionally wraps responses in markdown code blocks even when you ask for plain JSON. I added a simple cleanup function to strip these:

```typescript
function cleanJsonResponse(text: string): string {
  return text.replace(/```json\n?/g, '').replace(/```\n?/g, '').trim();
}
```

### Cost Optimisation: Sonnet → Haiku

I originally built with Claude Sonnet for development (better at following complex instructions). Once everything worked, I switched to Haiku for production.

**The result: 90% cost reduction** with no noticeable quality loss for this use case.

| Model | Cost per bottle ID | Monthly (5 users, ~50 IDs) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Sonnet | ~$0.01 | ~$0.50 |
| Haiku | ~$0.001 | ~$0.05 |

For simple, structured tasks like "identify this bottle", Haiku is more than capable.

### Voice Input with Web Speech API

The Web Speech API is surprisingly capable - and completely free. The key considerations:

1. **Australian English** - I set `recognition.lang = 'en-AU'` for better accuracy with local accents
2. **Continuous mode** - Keep listening until the user stops talking
3. **Error handling** - Browsers handle microphone permissions differently

```typescript
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = false;
recognition.interimResults = false;
recognition.lang = 'en-AU';

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  searchCocktails(transcript);
};
```

**Gotcha:** The Web Speech API requires HTTPS in production. Vercel handles this automatically.

### Kitchen Mode for Smart Displays

The Nest Hub Max has a 10" screen and runs a Chrome-based browser. I created a dedicated "Kitchen Mode" with:

- **Large touch targets** - Easy to tap with wet hands
- **High contrast** - Readable from across the kitchen
- **Simplified navigation** - Just the essentials
- **Auto-refresh** - Stays current without interaction

The trick is detecting when to offer Kitchen Mode. I check for touch capability and smaller viewport:

```typescript
const isKitchenDisplay = 
  'ontouchstart' in window && 
  window.innerWidth <= 1280 &&
  window.innerHeight <= 800;
```

### Multi-User with Row Level Security

Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) makes multi-user trivially easy. Each bottle record has a `user_id` column, and a simple policy ensures users only see their own data:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own bottles"
ON bottles FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

No application-level filtering needed - the database handles it.

## The Numbers

Here's what this actually costs to run:

| Service | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-------------|
| Vercel hosting | Free |
| Supabase (database + auth) | Free |
| Claude API (~50 bottle IDs) | ~$0.05 |
| **Total for 5 users** | **< $0.10** |

That's not a typo. The entire app runs for less than ten cents per month.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with the expensive model, then optimise

Building with Sonnet first meant I could iterate quickly without worrying about prompt engineering for a weaker model. Once the logic was solid, switching to Haiku was straightforward.

### 2. Handle AI response quirks defensively

Even with clear instructions, LLMs sometimes format responses unexpectedly. Always sanitise and validate AI outputs before using them.

### 3. Design for your actual use case

Kitchen Mode wasn't in the original spec. It emerged from actually using the app while cooking - and now it's my favourite feature.

### 4. Free tiers are genuinely useful

Between Vercel, Supabase, and the Web Speech API, the only cost is Claude API calls. Modern infrastructure makes hobby projects almost free to run.

## Try It Yourself

- **Live app:** [liquor-cabinet.vercel.app](https://liquor-cabinet.vercel.app)
- **Source code:** [github.com/spinbris/liquor-cabinet](https://github.com/spinbris/liquor-cabinet)

The app uses Google Sign-In, so you'll get your own private cabinet. Add a few bottles, and see what cocktails you can make.

## Building with Claude as a Development Partner

One meta-note: this entire project was built collaboratively with Claude as a development partner. I used a "Four Hats" workflow:

1. **Planner** (Claude) - Proposes designs and code
2. **Approver** (Me) - Reviews and greenlights
3. **Builder** (Claude) - Implements exactly what was approved
4. **Reviewer** (Both) - Verifies the build

This structured approach kept development moving quickly while maintaining quality. The app went from idea to production in a few focused sessions.

If you're interested in AI-assisted development workflows, that might be a topic for another post.
